      <p>We here in London have been following you and are great fans of your work. Based on your background, the team see you as someone whose opinion would be invaluable to the successful development of our soon-to-release project called the Bitcoin Comprehensive Risk Index.</p>

      <p>Our largely quant-finance team has the long-term vision of interfacing between the global capital markets and that of cryptocurrencies. With the recent exciting news regarding the potential introduction of CME futures and Bitcoin ETFs, we realise it may happen much sooner than originally anticipated. We are confident that your support for us would go a long way in us achieving that goal. That’s why getting our story across to you really matters to us:</p>

      <h4>What is the Bitcoin Comprehensive Risk Index?</h4>

      <p>The Bitcoin Comprehensive Risk Index is a simple tool that allows Bitcoin stakeholders to visualize the unique factors that affect the price of bitcoin. This product as a response to a noticeable gap in the market for a platform that can bring profound insight to a consumer audience without requiring them to have any prior knowledge. Moreover, we’ve noticed that existing tools focus only on presenting raw variables such as price and volume. We attribute this to the relative deficiency of literature surrounding the financial econometrics of cryptocurrencies. As such, developing the Bitcoin Comprehensive Risk Index has proven to be a two-sided struggle of achieving a rigorous methodology and a user-friendly presentation.</p>

      <br>

      <h4>How does it work?</h4>
      <p>The model focuses on the three risk areas of <i>speculation</i>, <i>centralisation</i>, and <i>market friction</i>. The choice of these areas was largely informed by the general sentiment of the community on where risks lie but also on what risks are possible to measure with some degree of rigour. Each of the three risk areas consist of an econometric model that takes several time series inputs. Together, the output of all 3 models make up the factors of the index. Both the factors and the index are published in real time, making it possible to attribute index movements to one or more of the underlying factors.</p>

      <br>

      <h4>Who can access the BCRI and how?</h4>

      <p>Anyone with an interest in Bitcoin will be able to access the BCRI through our website. This diverse audience ranges from casual enthusiasts to institutional investors who are considering futures or ETF exposure, and also to developers seeking an objective, third-party mechanism of feedback.</p>


      <br>
      <h4>Who made the BCRI and why?</h4>

      <p>The Bitcoin Comprehensive Risk Index is our debut project as Iceberg Analytics, a London based quantitative research initiative composed of individuals with backgrounds in Machine Learning, Mathematics, and Finance. Iceberg’s mission is to promote the development and integrity of the cryptocurrency markets for the ultimate benefit of society. Iceberg aspires to increase accessibility to critical measures of the current state of affairs. By doing so, it hopes to allow all parties to take actions that are most representative of the factual, as opposed to rumoured, status quo. While it is certainly true that Bitcoin is technically transparent, it is effectively opaque for the increasing number of stakeholders who do not possess the knowledge to be able to produce independent conclusions. The barriers to entry are far lower now due to the innumerable services that now allow individuals to become stakeholders while remaining in an alarming state of oblivion. One direct ramification of this mounting asymmetry of information is the needless volatility in price of Bitcoin. Unless acted upon, this will inevitably continue to be the case with the arrival of the late majority of adopters. This is why we believe that the functions of Iceberg as a service will be decisive in allowing the healthy adoption of Bitcoin.</p>

      <p>Lastly, Iceberg hopes to also serve as a risk gauge for developers, providing objective, real-time, feedback in key areas of risk such that timely action can be taken against the likelihood of adversities. Iceberg acknowledges the extraordinary standard of ethical duty that comes with assuming this role, and therefore makes a strong commitment to carrying out its operations with competence, diligence, and objectivity. While our team continues to work hard on delivering an initial beta release, we wanted to reach out to you and share our story.</p>

      <p> Our ask is this: that you share our message to others in the community who you think would derive value from our project. Should you be open to it, we would love to get your feedback on the concept and want to maintain and active dialogue with you.</p>

      <p>Warm wishes,<br> The <a href="index.html" target="_blank">Iceberg</a> Research Team</p>
