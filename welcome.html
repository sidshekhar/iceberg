      <p>We here in London have been following you and are great fans of your work. Based on your background, the team see you as someone whose opinion would be invaluable to the successful development of our soon-to-release project called the Bitcoin Comprehensive Risk Index.</p>

      <p>Our largely quant-finance team has the long-term vision of interfacing between the global capital markets and that of cryptocurrencies. With the recent exciting news regarding the potential introduction of CME futures and Bitcoin ETFs, we realise it may happen much sooner than originally anticipated. We are confident that your support for us would go a long way in us achieving that goal. That’s why getting our story across to you really matters to us:</p>
      
      <br>
      <h4>What is the Bitcoin Comprehensive Risk Index?</h4>

      <p>The Bitcoin Comprehensive Risk Index is a simple tool that makes it effortless for Bitcoin stakeholders to track the unique factors that stand between Bitcoin in its current form and the riskless ideal of a global decentralised currency. We’ve developed this product as a response to a noticeable gap in the market for a platform that can bring profound insight to a consumer audience without requiring them to have any particular set of skills. Moreover, we’ve noticed that existing tools focus only on presenting raw variables such as price and volume. We attribute this to the relative deficiency of prior literature surrounding the financial econometrics of cryptocurrencies. As such, developing the Bitcoin Comprehensive Risk Index has proven to be a two-sided struggle of achieving a rigorous methodology and a user-friendly presentation.</p>

      <br>

      <h4>How does it work?</h4>
      <p>The model focuses on the three risk areas of speculation, centralisation, and market friction. The choice of these areas was largely informed by the general sentiment of the community on where risks lie but also on what risks are possible to measure with any degree of rigour. Each area consists of a unique econometric model that takes several time series inputs. Together, the output of all 3 models make up the factors of the index. Both the factors and the index are published in real time, making it possible to attribute index movements to one or more of the underlying factors.</p>

      <br>

      <h4>Who can use the BCRI and how?</h4>

      <p>Anyone with an interest in Bitcoin will be able to use the BCRI through our website, owing to our self-imposed constraint of ‘no-prior-knowledge-needed’. This diverse audience ranges from casual enthusiasts to traditional asset investors who are considering futures or ETF exposure, and even developers seeking an objective, third-party mechanism of feedback.</p>


      <br>
      <h4>Who made the BCRI and why?</h4>

      <p>The Bitcoin Comprehensive Risk Index is our debut project as Iceberg Analytics, a London based quantitative research initiative composed of individuals with backgrounds in Engineering, Mathematics, Finance, and Economics. We’ve made it Iceberg’s mandate to promote the development and integrity of the cryptocurrency markets for the ultimate benefit of society. Iceberg aspires to increase accessibility to critical measures of the current state of affairs. By doing so, it hopes to allow all parties to take actions that are most representative of the factual, as opposed to rumoured, status quo. While it is certainly true that Bitcoin is technically transparent, it is effectively opaque for the increasing number of stakeholders who do not possess the knowledge to be able to produce independent conclusions. Indeed, this was not an issue back when holding a stake in Bitcoin required one to have some degree of exposure to its practicalities. That barrier has since been broken by the innumerable services that now allow individuals to become stakeholders whilst remaining in an alarming state of oblivion. One direct ramification of this is mounting asymmetry of information is a needless volatility in price which in turn sets an upper bound for Bitcoin’s practicability as a payment system. Unless acted upon, this will inevitably continue to be the case with the arrival of the early and late majority of adopters. This is why we believe that the functions of Iceberg as a service will be decisive in allowing the healthy adoption of Bitcoin.</p>

      <p>Lastly, Iceberg hopes to also serve as a risk gauge for developers, providing objective, real-time feedback in key areas of risk such that timely action can be taken against the likelihood of adversities. Iceberg acknowledges the extraordinary standard of ethical duty that comes with assuming this role, and therefore makes a strong commitment to carrying out its operations with competence, diligence, and indisputable objectivity.</p>

      <p>While our team continues to work hard on delivering an external beta release, we wanted to reach out to you and share our story. It’d be great if you could spread our message to others who you think would benefit from our project. Should you be open to it, we’d also like to maintain an open dialogue with you in the future as part of due-diligence process.</p>

      <p>The team and I greatly look forward to hearing from you.</p>
